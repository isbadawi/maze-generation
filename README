This is just a quick python app to visualize maze generation algorithms.

A maze is a grid (width and height are specified on the command line). Each
cell is represented as an (x, y) tuple, where (0, 0) is the top left. This
grid is stored as a graph; if two cells are adjacent in this graph, then
there is no wall between them.

Algorithms can be added by writing functions in maze.generators. An
implementation of an algorithm should yield edges (pairs of (x,y)
coordinates) one-by-one. The function name automatically becomes one of the
allowed choices for the --algorithm command line switch.
